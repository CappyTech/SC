        <h1>Understanding Our Economic System</h1>
        <h2>In-Game Activities vs. Real-World Transactions</h2>

        <subtitle>Our server offers a unique economic experience that operates with the following principles:</subtitle>
        <ul>
            <li class="mt-2 mb-4 courier">
                <span class="minecraft-bold">External Currency Management</span>:
                <p class="mt-2">All currency used within our server is managed through an
                    external
                    system,
                    separate from the Minecraft game environment. This means that while you can earn and spend within
                    the
                    context of the game, the actual transactions are processed outside of Minecraft.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="mt-4 mb-4 courier">
                <span class="minecraft-bold">Real-Time Processing</span>: <p class="mt-2">Transactions are executed with
                    the same speed as in-game actions,
                    but it's
                    important to
                    understand
                    that these transactions take place on a separate, secure platform designed to handle real-world
                    digital
                    currency.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="mt-4 mb-4 courier">
                <span class="minecraft-bold">Educational Purpose</span>: <p class="mt-2">The economic model is designed
                    for educational engagement, allowing
                    players to
                    learn
                    about digital
                    currency and economic principles in a simulated environment.</p>

            <li class="mt-4 mb-4 courier">
                <span class="minecraft-bold">No In-Game Currency</span>: <p class="mt-2">We do not use an in-game
                    currency that can be bought with or
                    exchanged for
                    real-world
                    money. Our
                    system is designed to provide a learning experience about digital currencies without violating
                    Microsoft's
                    policies.</p>

            <li class="mt-4 mb-4 courier">
                <span class="minecraft-bold">Clear Separation</span>: <p class="mt-2">There is a clear separation
                    between your in-game progress and your
                    external wallet.
                    While
                    in-game
                    achievements and assets remain within Minecraft, any use of digital currency takes place outside the
                    game,
                    in a separate
                    economic system.</p>

                    responsible for managing your external wallet.
                    We provide
                    the
                    tools
                    and
                    educational resources, but the management of your digital currency is in your hands, outside of the
                    Minecraft platform.</p>

                    questions
